Description:
Our website is dedicated to providing up-to-date information about the NBA playoffs. We offer an interactive navigation bar that allows users to easily access the playoff schedule, current standings, and playoff bracket. Additionally, users can purchase tickets to their preferred playoff games. The site also features a dropdown menu that displays scores from the previous day. On the left-hand side of the website, we provide the latest ESPN headlines with links to related articles. Users can search to find any playoff team and view their current stats, as well as those of their opponents. While the API used in this website has some limitations in filtering out non-playoff teams, it displays the last regular season game played for any non-playoff team. Once a user searches for their preferred playoff team, the website displays the searched team and their opponent during the playoffs and sorts them by home and away teams. Each team's field goal percentage (fgp), 3-point percentage, and total points scored during the 2022-2023 regular season are displayed. The five boxes underneath show the last five games played by the teams, with the most recent being playoff games and the remainder being regular season games.
